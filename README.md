# Calculator
## What I've done
I've made a calculator which contains a total of **16 buttons**. Those buttons are 4 different mathematical operations, 10 numbers, an equal button and a clear button.
The result is displayed in an entry field above.

## What I hope to implement
Definetly add more mathematical operations.
